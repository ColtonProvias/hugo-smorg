# hugo-smorg

From the [github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg project](https://github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg) README:

Responsive, minimalistic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme suitable for an individual or small organization.

**Note**: May 2, 2018 - This is a work in progress; in the next day or so for
a minimally working theme will be checked in; once functional I'll be adding
capabilities over time.

## Motivation

I've started this project to document how to use and customize Hugo as much for my own
benefit, as well as provide a relatively easy to work with base to use as is or
extend for new projects. This theme will keep pace with current Hugo features.
