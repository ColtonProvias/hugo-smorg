This is an example site for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the custom Hugo
theme [hugo-smorg](https://github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg).

## Using

1. First, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/);

2. Then, clone this repository:
	git clone https://github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg.git

3. Run Hugo:
	cd hugo-smorg/exampleSite
	hugo server

To modify the CSS you'll want some tools - install `node` and `npm` and wihtin
the project directory:

	cd hugo-smorg
	npm install

This will grab node-sass, Bulma and some useful tools used by the `npm` build
scripts you'll find in `package.json`.
